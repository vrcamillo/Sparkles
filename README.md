# Sparkles
A particle system demo written in C++ and OpenGL.

## Roadmap
This demo is currently in development. 

I plan to make it into a multi-platform library that supports other graphics APIs, such as D3D12 and Vulkan.  

In the near future, I will add screenshots, descriptions, and build instructions here.
